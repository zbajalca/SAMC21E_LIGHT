# SAMC21E_LIGHT

  This repository contains some early tests and experiments with the SAMC21E microcontroller in a dyson vacuum cleaner.  
It’s not a complete or production-ready project – just initial attempts to get things running, share code snippets, and maybe help someone facing similar issues.  

Feel free to look around, use parts of it, or suggest improvements.
